# learn_journ

New to it, practicing beginner concepts, this is my Learning Journal. 

I have been practicing using the "web developer bootcamp" on udemy now for about 2 weeks, ive decided to start scribbling my thoughts and learnings down in order to better keep track of my progress, better conclude and condense what ive learnt during each session, try to unpack my thoughts and hopefully destresss during the learning process. On the 6th of Febuary 2022 I will begin a 10 month part-time,software engineering bootcamp, this study is the prequel to that. My goal is to encorporate the "No Zero Days" attitude towards my studies.


<b>Friday 26.11.21:</b> 

Today I learned and practiced;
- Running Javascript in the browser
- conditional statements and nesting conditional statements
- The concept of Truthy and Falsy
- The Logical operstors && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
- Switch statements
- 
None of these concepts were very hard to grasp.


<b>Saturday 27.11.21:</b> 

Today I learned and practiced;
- Creating Arrays
- Array index and manipulating arrays using idices
- Simple Array methods including, push() pop() shift() unshift() concat() includes() indexOf() reverse() slice() and sort()

These concepts were not very hard to learn and apply, I did have trouble with the array method .sort(), more practice is needed to fully understand when and where to implement.

<b>Sunday 28.11.21:</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- The basic concept of objects and object creation
- acccessing data from objects
- modifying objects 
- nesting objects
- pairing objects and arrays and how powerful they can be together.

I enjoyed learning these concepts, its plain to see just how important objects and arrays can be in modern websites when it comes to categorizing and storing different types of data. I look forward to practicing them further.
