# learn_journ

New to it, practicing beginner concepts, this is my Learning Journal. 

I have been practicing using the "web developer bootcamp" on udemy now for about 2 weeks, ive decided to start scribbling my thoughts and learnings down in order to better keep track of my progress, better conclude and condense what ive learnt during each session, try to unpack my thoughts and hopefully destresss during the learning process. On the 6th of Febuary 2022 I will begin a 10 month part-time,software engineering bootcamp, this study is the prequel to that. My goal is to encorporate the "No Zero Days" attitude towards my studies.


<b>Friday 26.11.21:</b> 

Today I learned and practiced;
- Running Javascript in the browser
- conditional statements and nesting conditional statements
- The concept of Truthy and Falsy
- The Logical operstors && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
- Switch statements

None of these concepts were very hard to grasp.


<b>Saturday 27.11.21:</b> 

Today I learned and practiced;
- Creating Arrays
- Array index and manipulating arrays using idices
- Simple Array methods including, push() pop() shift() unshift() concat() includes() indexOf() reverse() slice() and sort()

These concepts were not very hard to learn and apply, I did have trouble with the array method .sort(), more practice is needed to fully understand when and where to implement.

<b>Sunday 28.11.21:</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- The basic concept of objects and object creation
- acccessing data from objects
- modifying objects 
- nesting objects
- pairing objects and arrays and how powerful they can be together.

I enjoyed learning these concepts, its plain to see just how important objects and arrays can be in modern websites when it comes to categorizing and storing different types of data. I look forward to practicing them further.

<b>Monday 29.11.21:</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- For-loops 
- Looping over arrays
- Looping over nested arrays with nested for-loops
- While-loops
- The horror of infinte-loops

Todays concepts where challenging, especially nested for-loops, in this moment I feel like I understand the concept and implementation on a basic level, however I will be re-doing this module from the start tomorrow to make sure I retain the most important parts. I feel like looping will be an intergal part of being a developer.

<b>Tuesday 30.11.21:</b>
Today I learned and practiced/repracticed;
- For-loops 
- Looping over arrays
- Looping over nested arrays with nested for-loops
- While-loops
- The Break keyword 
- The use of the parseInt()function for parsing user input

and created a simple guessing game (not originally mine) incorporating all of these aspects. I have a fair understanding of loops, they will take much more practice nonetheless. file uploaded under/Guessing Game

<b>Wednesday 1.12.21:</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- for...of looping, concept and implementation
- for...if looping, concept and implementation

and created an in browser, interactive to-do list stored in the browser console (not originally mine), this was very challenging for me at my current level but it incorporates ; user prompts, parsing of user prompts, arrays, array methods, variables, logical operators, temporal literals, if and if else statments, while loops and iteration of arrays. I could not recall all of these concepts without googling and was stuck multiple times on where and how to implement them, looking forward to practicing further until I can retain at least these basic concepts deeper and utilise more fluently. file uploaded under/toDoList.


<b>Thursday 2.12.21:</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- I re-created the todo list code from yesterday to help further cement the concepts, having a bit of a low Motivation day after doing an extra long shift at work so today has been about revision of past modules and listening to the codeNewbie podcaast to help inspire me! tomorrow I am on to the functions module.

<b>Friday 3.12.21:</b> 
Today I learned and prracticed;
- functions and their purpose
- function parameters 
- function arguments
- multi parameter/multi argument functions and returns
- The return keyword. 

Functions seem to be excepctionally common in writing code, the concept is not too hard to grasp although I can see how in depth they can be. Super useful, definetly one of the things to understand with solid depth and confidence.


<b>Saturday 4.12.21:</b>
Today I learned and continued practicing functions, I practiced using Udemy's fuction practice exercises, having a little trouble with getting the syntax spot on first time when saving loops or if/else statements to functions. I find myself not trusting myself to have properly understood but figuring out the error is just a misspelled declaration or braces/parenthesis missing. Learning to trust myself, lots of practice coming up.


<b>Sunday 5.12.21:</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- Function Scope 
- The difference between block and lexical scope
- how to apply nesting within funtions in order to give all child decendants of the function acesss to parent elements through lexical scope. 

Lots more left in this module, the scope concept was not too hard to grasp.

<b>Monday 6.12.21:</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- Function expressions, saving functions into variables
- Higher order functions, functions that operate on/with other functions
- Creating and defining methods

Learned and practiced all the above, lots to take in, I can see just how in depth and layered functions can be, defining my own methods is a skill I feel will really come in handy in the future 

<b>Tuesday 7.12.21:</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- revison of previous day
- defining methods exercise (udemy) 
- utilizing the keyword (this)
- coding exercise (laying eggs) udemy 
- The Try/Catch procedure 

Had a good morning, revised the past day's learnings (might start all sessions this way) passed all exercises without too much of a struggle and moving on to the next module tomorrow, Callbacks and Array methods. 

<b>Wednesday 8.12.21:</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- The forEach callback method
- The map callback method 
- Arrow function expressions
- Arrow function implicit returns 
- setTimeout and setInterval

Revised pervious days learnings, had fun learning some new methods and figuring out how to further compact written code using arrow functions and explict returns, the new syntax will take some practice but definetly saves time and leaves the code looking much neater. 

<b>Thursday 9.12.21:</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- revision of previous day
- The filter method
- some/every methods
- Reduce method 

It has been a shorter study session today, as I have to go in to work early. Revised and praciticed with arrow functions and the map/forEach methods again, then learned how to implement the filter/some/every methods. There are a large number of implementaions for array callbacks, knowing which one to implement is what im trying to practice as the syntax between them seems pretty similar.

<b>Friday 10.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- Revised all previous exercises of the previous module 
- Reduce method syntax and applicaiton 
- How to utilise arrow functions with the keyword "this' 
- How to set default params

Feeling good today, didnt struggle with any of the previous exercises although I know there is much more practice to be had, moved on to the reduce method which seems really useful for array iteration, how using the keyword "this" while writing methods may change the output when used together with arrow function declaration, and also how newer javascript allows us to  easily set default parameters within parenthesisis and not in the function body anymore, although order is key for multiple parameters.

<b>Saturday 11.12.21</b>
Today I learnes and practiced; 
- Spread in function calls
- Spread with array literals
- Spread with objects 
- Rest Params
- Destructuring Arrays 
- Destructuring objects
- Destructuring Params

A lot to take in today with these newer Javascript features, seems its possible to work without any of these functions but they make the code alot easier to understand, read and to write. Spread and Destrucuring in particular are very useful and I plan to practice them further and try to encorporate them into my everyday coding as much as possible.

<b>Sunday 12.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced; 
- About the Document Object Model 
- How to interact with the DOM
- using getElementsById to grab and store objects within a variable.

Moving on to the DOM manipulaiton and practice module, excited for the change of pace.

<b>Monday 13.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- getElementsByTagName
- getElementsByClassName
- querySelector
- querySelectorAll
- innerHTML
- innerText
- innerContent

Continued with practice of DOM manipulation today, practiced selecting singular elements using querySelector and also groups of elements using querySelectorAll and returning groups using tag names, class names and specfic attributes from the markup. Really fun to start utilising javascript to interact with the markup and style sheet. 

<b>Tuesday 14.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- Revison from previous session
- Attribute selection in the DOM 
- Changing styles through attribute slection in the DOM 
- practiced using multiple Udemy exercises 

Found some of the syntax for attribute selection through Javascript a bit challenging today, trying to incorporate stylings using javascript through the DOM using partial CSS syntax was slightly confusing at times, although when an approproate element is selected its all about practicing what you can do with that element. Started incorporating standard for and forOf loops to interact with the markup today, feels good to be able to put it all into practice, still not getting all the syntax right without some research... practice practice practice... and patience. 

<b>Wednesday 15.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced; 
- Revision of previous session
- classList fuctions including add/contains/remove and toggle 
- Traversing using parent/child/sibling slectors
- The append/appendChild funtions 
- Multiple Udemy exercises to practice the above, added to DOMprac file. 

Practiced all the above and spent extra time doing the coding exercises, happy to have gotten to the right answers for the coding exercises without having to do any extra research today, hoping to find some beginner projects that incorporate what ive learned in these sections, wanting to make sure I retain it all. 



<b>Thursday 16.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced; 
- Revision of the previous session 
- removeChild and remove 

I finished a bigger coding exercise today utilizing what ive learnt so far in manipulating the DOM, uploaded file under PokemonDOM_practice. It was really fun figuring this one out and being able to utilse minor HTML,CSS and Javascript. 

<b>Friday 17.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced; 
- revison of the previous sessions and exercises
- Intro into DOM events
- Why inline event declaration directly in the markup is bad practice
- onClick and onDblCLick events 
- Exercises on declaring these events. 

Made it to another friday, listened to one of my favourite podcasts "Breaking into Startups" in this episode they interview Jake Schwartz, CEO of general assembly, it left me feeling inspired and really excited to start my bootcamp, less than 2 months away now...
Moved on to the DOM events module of my course, excited to push forward, 'Events' seem to be a super important part of user interaction. 

<b>Saturday 18.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- Revision of previous learnings and exercises 
- how the onclick property works 
- mouseover event 
- upclick, downclick events 
- addEventListener

Continued on with DOM events today, nothing too hard to grasp and apply so far. 


<b>Sunday 19.12.21</b>
Today I created an in browser random color generator, this project is part of the Udemy course, I tried to do it without any instruction and found it fun to do and fairly simple, after creating the fucntion color generator I veiwed the source code of the Udemy instructor I found there were a few points at which I couldve written cleaner more effiecnt and less repeitive code. uploaded file under /Random Color Generator

<b>Monday 20.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced; 
- Revision of previous session
- Keyword "this" utilization with with events 
- Keyboard events
- Event Objects

Practiced the above, learning to put utilise the keyword 'this' within Events, challenging at times. 

<b>Tuesday 21.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced; 
- Form Events 
- The preventDefault function for one page form submition 

Practiced grabbing user input from froms and storing info within lists to be used later. Pretty simple as long as the proper order and scope is followed. 

<b>Wednesday 22.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced; 
- Revison of past session
- Input and Change events 
- input events exercise 
- Event bubbling 
- Event Delegation 

Practiced all the above and made sure to practice the past exercises for this module aswell, I have enjoyed the DOM events module and feel like I have a much better understanding of how user input is intergrated into modern websites. Need to keep practicing to make sure I am comfortable with it all.

<b>Thursday 23.12.21</b>

Today I started working on a scorekeeper app desginated by the Udemy course, trying to make it thorugh without any help initally to see what areas I need to improve on. Tommorow I will start delegating time towards both the project and pushing on with course work.

<b>Friday 24.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced; 
- The concept of Async Javascript 
- The call stack 
- WebAPI's and the concept of single threading 
- Call back practice. 

Lots to take in today, Seems this module is going to be fairly dense. Understanding the call stack seems fairly simple but its easy to see how callbacks with mulitple functions nested, each with multiple arguments, which could contain a fucntion, which in turn leads to more nested functions.... could be tricky. Going to try and take some extra time during this module to ensure better retention.

<b>Saturday 25.12.21</b>
Today I listened to the codeNewbie Podcast <b>S11 Ep2</b> Angie Jones is interviewed about why all Developers should understand the basics of testing. Angie was a senior software engineer at Twitter and she speaks on the fact that she never really wanted to be in the testing department at twitter but after 3 months she never wanted to leave, A good testing procedure is critical for site and app efficency, the skills transfer to every area of coding, and if the developer has a understanding of what the testers do while testing code, it will lead to a much more fluid and effiecnt final product with minimal double handling.

<b>Sunday 26.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced; 
- Nested callbacks
- Nested callbacks within requests
- The use of Promises While making requests 
- .then and .catch methods 
- resolved or rejected requests

Slowly making it through the theory behind making requests to servers/API's and returning "resolved" or "rejected". This module has alot to take in and some of the syntax and procedures are a little hard to grasp the first time, but pushing forward and trying to get a basic understanding before my bootcamp starts next year. Asynchronous Javascript will be a subject I bring up with my teachers to help solidify the concept.

<b>Monday 27.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- Creating promises 
- The Async keyword 
- The Await Keyword
- Asynch Functions 
- Handling errrors in async functions

Alot to take in today, My final decision is to re-do the whole Asynch Javascript module at a later date, this has been a dense subject and it has not sunk in to the level I want it to. Struggling with certain aspects of it. Hopefully round two will be more fluid...

<b>Tuesday 28.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- Introduction to AJAX (AJAJ)
- Introduction to API's 
- Introduction to JSON
- using POSTMAN to inspect using url's
- Project work (movie seat booking project)

Awesome introduction into a couple things I have heard mentioned alot but never really understood AJAX, (web)API's and JSON, with these subjects the "request and respose" aspects of the module start to make a little more sense. Lots to take in but really enjoying learning more about how everything starts to come together.

<b>Wednesday 29.12.21</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- Using Query strings and Headers
- Making XHR's
- The Fetch API 
- Intro into AXIOS
- Finished movie seat booking project 

Continued on with the module today, starting to understand a little better how browser requests are made utilising query strings based off the user search, how Requests can be made within our code utilizing API keys, how XHR's are outdated and the new applicable procedures are to utilzie fetch and AJAX when dealing with API's.

<b>Thursday 30.12.21</b>

Working on the revision of the Asycnc Javascript module today, as decided earlier, I will be going through everything revolving around asynchronous javascript for the next couple of sessions before moving on to the next sections.

<b>Friday 31.12.21</b>

Continued on with thorough revision of creating promises and also utilizing the return of promises, working on getting a thorough foundational understanding of how promises work on both the declaration and return sides, for today I utilized the .then and the .catch functions for returning, during the next session I will be focusing on utilizing the asynch and await keywords. The second time through this module has certainly made more sense I think it has been extremly important for me to slow down and realise some concepts are just a little more time consuming to grasp.

<b>Saturday 1.01.22</b>
Today I learned and practiced;
- Async keyword 
- Await keyword
- Handling errors in Async functions

Practiced using the Async/Await style of promise declaration and return, much easier to use, the only differences to the .then/.catch method seems to be when we are actually declaring a promise (the Async keyword itself returns a promise without any other declaration) AND the fact that we have to utilize try/catch when returning because the async/await method doesnt "catch" errors when returning.

<b>Sunday 2.01.22</b>
Today I learned and practiced;

An introduction to react, moving on with a new course on udemy, Modern react. looking forward to it.

<b>Monday 3.01.22</b>

Revison work practicing use of AJAX, parsing JSON, returning API data, POSTMAN and working with query strings and headers.

<b>Tuesday 4.01.22</b>
- re-Introduction to AXIOS
- Setting headers with AXIOS 

Lots of practice again today with making reqests and handling responses to those requests, Today I utilized the AXIOS library in my code as opposed to the native route using fetch. When using Axios to request data form a web API, our data is returned in JSON parsed, as opposed to using the fetch keyword which at times requires us to parse in order to utilize our data object. Made an app that returns the current price of bitcoin in AUD to practice getting data from an API.

<b>Wednesday 05.01.22</b>

Today I created a TV show search web app utilizing a free tv show search web API, the app displays the image of all tv shows searched for in the browser, just to practice returning data from API's, lots to take in but it was really fun practice, struggled with refreshing the page to clear all images ready for the new search, will have to continue with that and update.

<b>Thursday 06.01.22</b>
- Introduction to React
- Introduction to Components
- Server set up
- Difference between function and class components

Continuing on with the pre-bootcamp prep, Moving on to the world of React, inital thoughts are it seems like an awesome idea to combine HTML,CSS and JS in one file to utilize all of them. Will need to get used to creating components and being able to Re-Use components later on in the code. Looking foward to the next step.

<b>Friday 07.01.22</b>
- Basic rules of JSX 
- How JSX works behind the scenes 
- Embedding Javascript in JSX 
- Conditionals in JSX 
- Standard react app layout 

Continued on with the react course, working today on learning JSX syntax and how to embed Javascript within JSX. Writing components using the class style as opposed to function, also practicing using a live server to test the application and learning how Babel works as a javascript compiler has also been cool to dive into.

<b>Saturday 08.01.22</b>
- Introduction to props
- Prop immutablility
- Other types of props

Practicing with adding properties to return with the code, Props make our code more configurable and customizable, it also means we can re-use code by utilizing specific props. I have also started practicing specific javascript problems using Code Wars, just to keep some practice up.

<b>Sunday 09.01.22</b>

Today I practiced ustilizing props doing the multiple exercises on the Udemy Course, the goal for the last exercise was to create a logially functioning "slot machine" that would randomise and return wins or losses dependant on the same numbers, Becauase im so new to react this exercise took me a while but I got there in the end and feel a little more confident with utilizing properties in react. I also completed one kata exercise on Code wars.
