# learn_journ

New to it, practicing beginner concepts, this is my Learning Journal. 


Friday 26.11.21: 
I have been practicing using the "web developer bootcamp" on udemy now for about 2 weeks, ive decided to start scribbling my thoughts and learnings down in order to better keep track of my progress, better conclude and condense what ive learnt during each session, try to unpack my thoughts and hopefully destresss during the learning process. On the 6th of Febuary 2022 I will begin a 10 month part-time,full stack developer bootcamp with Academy XI, this study is the prequel to that.

Today I learned and practiced;
- Running Javascript in the browser
- conditional statements and nesting conditional statements
- The concept of Truthy and Falsy
- The Logical operstors && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
- Switch statements
None of these concepts were very hard to grasp.
